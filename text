Linux driver model

2.4 all driver subsystems were isolated
we needed to solve power management suspend/resume
	device naming

Pat Mochel and I worked on this


struct device

	all types of "devices" in the kernel get this structure
	automatic reference counting
	associated with a specific "bus" or "subsystem/class"



Bottom up

kobjects
	reference counting
	sysfs representation
	data structure glue
		links between different kobjects and types of kobjects
	hotplug event handling


kref
	reference counting
	lock has to be outside of the object
	has to have a release function to free the object


ktype
s
